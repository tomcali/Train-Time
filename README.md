# Train-Time
Homewook involves setting up a Firebase database for a train schedule. 


## Overview
I continue to work with Bootstrap 4, which is currently in alpha release. Bootstrap itself requires jQuery.

We set up the structure for the DOM. And defined the database for the work.

## Viewing the Websites... not yet

The website is incomplete as it currently stands. Firebase structure is there. DOM structure is there. But still much to do to make it all work.

## Technologies Used

- HTML
- CSS (style.css after Bootstrap 4 css and Yeti Bootswatch)
- JavaScript (via Bootstrap 3) 
- Set data structures implemented via JavaScript objects
- Git/GitHub
- Bootstrap and Bootstrap components for responsive design
- jQuery for event handling
- Firebase
- moment.js for date/time work


## Code Explanation

-the firebase setup Javascript program is finished
-the DOM structure is in place
